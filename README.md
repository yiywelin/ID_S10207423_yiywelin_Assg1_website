# ID Assignment Project 1
<h3>Overview of the Project</h3>
<p>This project aims to design and develop a front-end responsive website using HTML, CSS, Javascript and modern web development techniques. It would be a website about real-life music band which caters for the band's audience who tend to learn more about the band and the band's members. The website will also include some special features for the fans for example, buying music album of the band or booking concert tickets. On the other hand, the goal of the site owner is to publicize and promote the sales of band's music and get more gigs.</p>

<h3>Design Process</h3>
<p>The website is about a popular k-pop girl band called "BLACKPINK". Basically, the website is catering for a strong global fandom of BLACKPINK, who are also known as "BLINKS" and the website's main purpose is to offer one-stop service to not only the passionate BLINKS but also for everyone who are interested about BLACKPINK. By using the website, users will be able to discover more about the history of girl-group, get to know details of the group members, keep updated with the latest album of the group and book for the upcoming concerts. In total, the website consists of 4 pages- Home, About, Album, and Concert.</p>
<h4>Theme</h4>
<p>Blank and pink colors are used as the main theme colors of the website since the name of the girl-group is BLACKPINK.</p>

<h4>User Stories</h4>
<ul>
<li>As a person who wishes to learn more about BLACKPINK, I can visit the 'About' Page to find out details of the group and the group members. The details of each group member is provided together with the portrait of the member as well as the instagram account. So, it's really easy and convenient for me to get to know more about each member.</li><br>
<li>As an engaging BLINK, I can quickly check the latest news, events and albums of the group just by browsing through the 'Home' Page of the website. For example, the website portrays the inclusive information about the latest album of BLACKPINK, including the album's poster, short description about the album, music video and also the detailed tracklist of the album. Thus, I can get all the information in one go.</li><br>
<li>As a k-poper who wants to view BLACKPINK's music albums or book tickets for BLACKPINK music concert, I can easily go to 'Album' Page to see the albums together with the detailed lists of songs. Furthermore, on 'Concert' Page, the schedule of the band's concerts are displayed in very straightforward way and I can easily book the tickets as well. I can also see the posters of the previous concerts which makes me really excited and thrilled.</li>
