		<h3>WHO IS BLACKPINK?</h3>
		<p>Blackpink is a South Korean girl band that was formed by YG Entertainment. Though the first member joined the label as a trainee in 2010, the group didn't make their debut until August of 2016, when they released their first single album, Square One. As for the group's music, it's mainly a mix of K-pop, EDM and hip hop, although some of their songs (like "As If It's Your Last") have been described as a "mixed genre of music. Blackpink has a strong fanbase stretching far beyond South Korea and the group proved their global popularity by a successful world tour and performing at 'Coachella', the biggest music festival in the United States.</p>

    <h3>Why are they called BLACKPINK?</h3>
    <p>The group’s name was conceived to contrast with the perception of femininity commonly associated with the color pink. When Blackpink debuted, their label YG Entertainment said the name intends to convey that the group embodies more than beauty. “I may look sweet, but I don’t act like it,” Jennie sings in the opening lines of “Ddu-Du Ddu-Du,” echoing this message.</p>

        <p style="font-family: Zilla Slab; text-align:justify; color: black;">Blackpink’s main rapper, who also sings, Jennie was a “trainee” for just shy of six years — the longest of the members.

She was the first member of Blackpink to release an individual track, titled “SOLO.” The music video showcased her versatility as both a rapper and singer, while further establishing her as a fashion icon through the more than 20 outfits worn within the three-minute clip.</p>
